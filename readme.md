# Mercature Tasks - Rust Programming Projects

## Task 1: String Manipulation
A simple program that takes two strings, creates slices from them, and concatenates these slices together. The program demonstrates basic string operations in Rust.

## Task 2: Task Management System
A command-line task manager that allows users to:
- Add new tasks with priorities (High, Medium, Low)
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- View all tasks with their status
  

## Task 3: Banking System
A basic banking system that implements:
- Account creation with initial balance
- Deposit and withdrawal operations
- Balance checking
- Error handling for invalid transactions


## Task PassVault: Password Manager
A secure command-line password manager that enables users to:
- Store service credentials (service name, username, password)
- List all stored credentials
- Search for specific service credentials
- Secure data storage using JSON format

## Task RuSTOCK: Inventory Management System
A comprehensive store inventory management system that provides:
- Complete product inventory management (CRUD operations)
- Sales and purchase tracking to manage stock levels
- Generation of text-based reports for inventory, sales, and purchase history
- Secure data persistence using SQLite database
- Detailed product tracking (name, description, price, quantity)
- User-friendly terminal interface with ASCII art logo
- Robust input validation and error handling

## RiseIn-Tasks/voting_system: Decentralized Voting System
A decentralized voting dApp built on the Internet Computer that allows users to:
- Create, edit, and end proposals
- Vote (Approve/Reject/Pass) on active proposals
- Interact with a Rust backend smart contract via a React and Vite frontend
- Persist data using stable structures

## RiseIn-Tasks/open_lot: Decentralized Auction System
A decentralized auction smart contract built on the Internet Computer that allows users to:
- List items for auction with a starting price and optional duration
- Place bids on active auctions
- Utilizes a Rust backend with `StableBTreeMap` for persistent item and bid storage
