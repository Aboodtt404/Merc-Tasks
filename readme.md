# Mercature Tasks - Rust Programming Projects

## Task 1: String Manipulation
A simple program that takes two strings, creates slices from them, and concatenates these slices together. The program demonstrates basic string operations in Rust.

## Task 2: Task Management System
A command-line task manager that allows users to:
- Add new tasks with priorities (High, Medium, Low)
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- View all tasks with their status

The system uses emojis to make the interface more user-friendly and includes basic error handling for invalid inputs.

## Task 3: Banking System
A basic banking system that implements:
- Account creation with initial balance
- Deposit and withdrawal operations
- Balance checking
- Error handling for invalid transactions

The system uses Rust's trait system to define standard account behavior and includes basic validation for all transactions.
